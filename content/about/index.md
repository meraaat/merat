# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hello! I'm **MerAt Akbari**, a dedicated and innovative software engineer with a strong passion for solving complex problems through technology. Over the years, I've honed my expertise in backend development, mobile applications, and scalable system design, contributing to impactful projects across various domains.

# 🚀 My Journey

🎓 hold a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Engineering** from Kermanshah University of Technology, which laid the foundation for my journey in software engineering.
I started my career developing a Java-based e-commerce application, where I collaborated with UI/UX teams to deliver an intuitive user experience. Pivoting to Flutter, I achieved a 40% increase in user engagement by enhancing UI/UX with animations and modern design principles. My passion for delivering high-quality products also led me to develop a cross-platform application for an insurance company and a startup, helping the latter achieve a 20% monthly user growth.

Transitioning to backend development, I embraced Golang to create scalable and reliable services using Domain Driven Data Oriented structures. My work has consistently improved development speed, product reliability, and sales performance. I've also played a key role in setting up CI/CD pipelines, automating container management with Kubernetes, and implementing Elasticsearch for data-driven systems.

# 💡 Why I Do What I Do

My mission is to build Technologies that simplify life and create meaningful experiences. Whether it's enhancing development processes, creating intuitive applications, or scaling systems for better performance, I strive to deliver results that matter.


# 🌟 Outside of Work

I am always eager to learn and explore new ideas and technologies. I also have a deep interest in sports, particularly martial arts and Kyokushin, which keep me disciplined, focused, and motivated.

Let's build something amazing together!
